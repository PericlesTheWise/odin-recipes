        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Sugar. Two cups of white sugar add the perfect amount of sweetness, while locking in the moisture from the other ingredients.</li>
                <li>Flour. All-purpose flour provides structure, acts as a thickening agent, and helps build the fluffy texture.</li>
                <li>Cocoa Powder. Of course, you'll want to use Hershey's brand unsweetened cocoa powder for this one. It adds the rich, indulgent flavor you know and love.</li>
                <li>Leaveners. Baking powder and baking soda act as leaveners, which means they cause the batter to expand and give the cake a perfect rise.</li>
                <li>Salt. Just a teaspoon of salt is all you'll need to add complexity and highlight the other flavors. It might not seem like a lot, but you'll definitely miss the salt if you skip it.</li>
                <li>Eggs. Whole eggs affect the cake in a number of ways: They provide structure, add moisture, lend flavor, and contribute to a tender texture.</li>
                <li>Milk. Whole milk adds moisture and helps the batter come together smoothly.</li>
                <li>Oil. Vegetable oil ensures your cake will never be dry.</li>
                <li>Vanilla. Two teaspoons of vanilla extract add complex flavor and bring out the flavors of the other ingredients, such as the cocoa powder.</li>
                <li>Boiling Water. You might be wondering why this recipe calls for a cup of boiling water. It intensifies the chocolatey flavor, contributes to the fluffy texture, and reacts with the leaveners to create an even higher rise.</li>
            </ul>
